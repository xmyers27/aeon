                  Gameplay includes a co-op mode (The Xbox 360 release only allows for internet co-op, while the PlayStation 3 release supports local multiplayer) which plays like the "Boss Rush Mode" of previous 2D Castlevania games, but with several rooms and items to find, culminating in a boss to fight. It also includes a versus mode, with battle occurring between players. Some bosses are able to attack players on their way to the fight. The game features playable characters 
                  such as Alucard, Soma Cruz, Jonathan Morris, Shanoa and Charlotte Aulin, all from previous 2D Castlevania games.

                  All of the characters include eight palette swaps to accommodate players that wish to be the same character. Through downloadable content, additional characters were released, including an 8-bit version of Simon Belmont. The characters have their own signature attacks and skills to use in battle. An all-new map system allows real-time zooming in and out of the current stage, which will not stop gameplay and even allow players to play with the map zoomed out.
                  Other features in the game include a grimoire placed in certain parts of levels, which is the only way to change items and equipment mid-game. Only one type of consumable item such as a potion can be equipped at a time, but it can be consumed at will. Some healing items have an area effect, so they can also be used to heal other players as well. Also, the experience point system from most newer 2D Castlevania games was replaced by a character-specific leveling system. 
                  Some characters must find weapons and equipment in order to improve their character, while others must level up sub-weapons or collect spells/ souls as a means of character growth. Alucard and Soma can equip most dropped weaponry, but Jonathan, Charlotte and Shanoa can only strengthen their main attack by upgrading sub-attacks, either by finding and using them or absorbing additional spells from monsters (Shanoa can also find a few rare weapons, unique to her only, to change her attack type and power).
